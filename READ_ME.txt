NOTE: 
Incase you want to give an audio through microphone then make sure you have python version 3.5.5 or 3.6.x because the module pyaudio works only on those versions.
If you want to categorize your own specific departments through audio, then you'll have to change the list values containing the possible words used for that particular departments conversations.
If your python version causes you trouble then please use jupyter notebook.
